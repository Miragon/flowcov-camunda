<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://flowcov.io)

Improve your workflow and decision models by testing them just as you test your code. FlowCov provides highly integrated tools to create, merge, archive and display coverage reports.

Why you should use it:
* Create coverage reports easily
* Integrates into every CI provider
* Upload reports with one line


Many thanks to the creators of the [Camunda BPM Process Test Coverage](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-process-test-coverage), which we took as an example for the coverage data generation.
